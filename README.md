# Finetune_Llama2model_PEFT-LORA-QlORA (Llama-2-7b-chat Fine-Tuning with QLoRA)
This project involves fine-tuning the Llama-2-7b-chat model using QLoRA (Quantized Low Rank Adaptation) on a reformatted dataset that follows the Llama 2 template. The goal is to achieve efficient fine-tuning with limited VRAM resources by leveraging parameter-efficient techniques and 4-bit precision.

Introduction
The Llama-2-7b-chat model is a large language model that can be resource-intensive to fine-tune. By using QLoRA, we can perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning, reducing VRAM usage significantly.

Installation
Several packages need to be installed to support the fine-tuning process, including accelerate, peft, bitsandbytes, transformers, and trl.

Dataset Preparation
The dataset used for fine-tuning was reformatted to follow the Llama 2 prompt template. The original dataset was sourced from OpenAssistant Guanaco. The reformatted datasets are available for different sample sizes.

Model Configuration
The Llama-2-7b-chat model was configured to operate in 4-bit precision using bitsandbytes. This included setting up the model and tokenizer, adjusting configurations to ensure efficient training, and preparing the model for LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation).

Fine-Tuning Process
The fine-tuning process involved:

Loading the required packages.
Loading the preprocessed dataset and configuring the model with 4-bit quantization.
Setting up LoRA parameters for efficient fine-tuning.
Configuring training parameters, including batch size, learning rate, and logging.
Initializing the trainer and starting the training process.
Training and Evaluation
Training progress was monitored using TensorBoard, providing insights into the model's performance over time. The training process was designed to be efficient, even with limited VRAM.

Model Saving and Deployment
After completing the fine-tuning process, the model was saved and prepared for deployment. The fine-tuned model can be pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for easy access and sharing.

Results
The fine-tuned Llama-2-7b-chat model demonstrated improved performance in generating human-like text. Examples of the model's output showcased its enhanced capabilities following the fine-tuning process.
